A Python API and CLI client for GaiaGPS. I wrote this for myself, but it may be useful for others. Gaia does not have a published API, so this was developed by reverse engineering the browser client and thus may be incomplete or poorly behaved. It is possible to use this to put undue strain on gaiagps.com, so please be judicious with its use. This client is not supported or blessed by Gaia, so do not complain about it to them or ask them for help.

Installation
------------

On a modern Linux (and MacOS with python3 from brew), something like this should work:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ git clone https://github.com/kk7ds/gaiagpsclient
  $ cd gaiagpsclient
  $ python setup.py install

CLI Usage
---------

The command line client will attempt to login to gaiagps.com only when necessary, caching the session credentials whenever possible. Thus, at least the first use requires your Gaia credentials, and any time after that session expires. After installation, try testing your connection, which will perform a login and validate that communication is possible:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ gaiagps --user user@domain.com test
  Password:
  Success!

After that, you can perform commands without providing your username or password.

The available high-level commands are displayed with ``--help``::

  $ gaiagps --help
  usage: gaiagps [-h] [--user USER] [--pass PASS] [--debug] [--verbose]
                 {waypoint,folder,test,tree,track,upload} ...

  Command line client for gaiagps.com

Help per-command is displayed the same way::

  usage: gaiagps waypoint [-h]
                          {add,remove,move,rename,export,list,dump,url,coords}

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Here are some example common operations to demonstrate usage::

  # Add a waypoint by lat/lon
  $ gaiagps waypoint add 'My Campsite' 45.123 -122.9876

  # Show the waypoints so far
  $ gaiagps waypoint list
  +--------------------------------+----------------------+------------------+

  |          My Campsite           | 19 Apr 2019 03:41:53 |                  |
  +--------------------------------+----------------------+------------------+

  # Create a folder and move our waypoint into that folder
  $ gaiagps folder add 'Camping Trip'
  $ gaiagps waypoint move 'My Campsite' 'Camping Trip'
  $ gaiagps waypoint list
  +--------------------------------+----------------------+------------------+
  |              Name              |       Updated        |      Folder      |

Testing and Docs
----------------

Tests are split into unit and functional groups. Unit tests can be run in isolation; functional tests run against gaiagps.com itself and require credentials to be set in the environment to run. As functional testing has the potential to generate potentialy-unwanted load on Gaia's servers, try to avoid running those more than necessary.

Testing and building docs requires tox::

  $ pip install tox
  $ tox -e style,unit,doc

Docs will be built and available in ``doc/build/index.html``, or you can `read them here<https://gaiagpsclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
